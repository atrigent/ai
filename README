My tic-tac-toe game uses the minimax algorithm. It is capable of using the multiplayer
formulation described in the textbook, with a vector of utilities at each node. It is slow
to start up because it generates the entire game tree at the beginning. This allows gameplay
to be smooth. Theoretically, this code could use more than two players or more than 3x3
boards. However, memory usage and CPU time limitations make that pretty impractical.

This code also implements all of the optimizations having to do with equivalent rotations
and reflections of the game board. This allows the game tree to be as small as possible. It
also stops expanding the game tree when a win or tie is encountered.

Gameplay is simple - just enter your move by entering the coordinates. The game will figure
it out, as long as there are two numbers in your input somewhere.

As a bonus, you can also play this game by sshing to tictactoe@67.189.145.86, password threeinarow.
